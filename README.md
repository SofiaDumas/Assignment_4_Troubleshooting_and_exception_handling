# Assignment N. 4 - Troubleshooting and Excpetion Handling: Programming Beyond Expected Results

## Description
This project is about troubleshooting and entering exception to let the code run and not crash. 

## Code Modification: 
Update 1: Added exception handling to file operations for file not found.
Update 2: Added two validations for the transaction type and the string, and created a tuple and appended the tuple to the rejected records.
Update 3: Run the debug and change one elif for if.
Update 4: Also change the formula which shows average transaction amount.
Update 5: Run the debug when the first withdraw transaction appeared and I had to correct the verb withdraw for it was written with an al and the variable was entered as withdraw. This change with made in the code and not in the csv file. I also had to correct the formula and replace the + for the - because it was adding the money instead of substracting it.
